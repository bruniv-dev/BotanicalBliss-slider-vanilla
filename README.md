Botanical Bliss

Welcome to Botanical Bliss, a beautifully designed website dedicated to showcasing the serene beauty of plants. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

Features:

1. Image Slider: The website includes an image slider that showcases four stunning plant images. The images transition every three(3) seconds, displaying corresponding content about each plant, providing a seamless and relaxing viewing experience.

2. Navigation Arrows: Users can navigate through the images using next and previous arrow buttons. Clicking these buttons will immediately display the respective image.

3. Auto-Slide: After 5 seconds of inactivity, the auto-slide feature resumes, ensuring the images continue to transition smoothly.

4. Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.

5. Interactive Buttons: The navigation buttons change color when hovered over, enhancing the interactive experience for users.

6. Plant Information: Each image is accompanied by corresponding information about the plant, including its name and a brief description.

7. Action Buttons: Each plant slide includes two buttons: 'Buy Now' and 'Know More'. These buttons also change color when hovered over, adding to the interactive design.

8. Pause on Hover: When the arrow keys and action buttons are hovered, the slider pauses, providing users with ample time to read the information or decide on an action.

9. Active Thumbnail Highlighting: The active thumbnail glows, while the other thumbnails appear dull, making it clear which slide is currently displayed.

10. Non-Clickable Thumbnails: The thumbnails are not clickable, ensuring that navigation is controlled only through the navigation arrows and auto-slide feature.
